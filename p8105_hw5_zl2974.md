# Problem 1

Read in the data.

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

# Problem 2

## Read the data

| arm     | subject\_id | number\_of\_week | observation |
| :------ | :---------- | ---------------: | ----------: |
| Control | 01          |                1 |        0.20 |
| Control | 01          |                2 |      \-1.31 |
| Control | 01          |                3 |        0.66 |
| Control | 01          |                4 |        1.96 |
| Control | 01          |                5 |        0.23 |
| Control | 01          |                6 |        1.09 |

## Plot data

 As we can see from above, the observation from experiment group starts
at the same level as the control group, increases as time passes, while
the observation in control group stays at the same level.

# Problem 3

## Generate simulation data

| mu | estimate | statistic | p.value | t\_accept\_h0 |
| -: | -------: | --------: | ------: | :------------ |
|  0 |    0.412 |     0.489 |   0.629 | TRUE          |
|  0 |    0.664 |     0.914 |   0.368 | TRUE          |
|  0 |    0.551 |     0.629 |   0.534 | TRUE          |
|  0 |    0.567 |     0.704 |   0.487 | TRUE          |
|  0 |  \-1.650 |   \-1.959 |   0.060 | TRUE          |
|  0 |    1.185 |     1.230 |   0.229 | TRUE          |

## Test for effect size and power

 As plot below, as the effect size of the difference between sample mean
and hypothesis population mean increase from 0 to 6, the power of
rejecting Null hypothesis increase.

## estiamte mu favor H1 and the True mu

![](p8105_hw5_zl2974_files/figure-gfm/plot_2-1.png)<!-- -->

 The average estimate mu which support for rejecting H0 and favor H1
approximates to the true mu at 0, 4, 5, 6. For case of true mu at 0, the
estimate mus of rejecting H0 are spreading on upper and lower side of
the true mu 0, because of the two-sided test mu we choose is 0. For the
other case, as shown in Fig.3, the power of rejecting H0 increases to
all most 1 as the effect size of difference between true mean and
hypothesis population surpasses 4. Thus, the average mu of rejecting H0
closes to true mean as true mean surpasses 4.
